/*!
 *  Returns a datetime by converting the given Microsoft
 *  <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/minwinbase/ns-minwinbase-filetime">FILETIME</a>,
 *  @a fileTime.
 *
 *  The first and last datetimes officially representable by a FILETIME structure are January 1 1970 0:00:00
 *  and Dec 31 30827 23:59:59 respectively, as it was designed to be compatible with Microsoft SYSTEMTIME.
 *
 *  The timezone of the resultant QDateTime is Qt::LocalTime.
 *
 *  @note The official FILETIME object from the Windows C API is a structure of two DWORD (32-bit) values that
 *  represent the low and high portion of the true signed 64-bit value of the FILETIME; however, FILETIME
 *  encoded information can be acquired from various sources such as raw data from files on disk. For this reason,
 *  this function's signature takes an unsigned 64-bit integer instead of the aforementioned struct. If working
 *  with actual FILETIME structures from the Windows C API the values of said structures must first be converted
 *  to single value integers in order to be used with this function. This implementation approach allows this
 *  module to avoid linking to the Windows library.
 *
 *  @warning FILETIME encoding has a resolution of 100 nanoseconds, while QDateTime is only 1 millisecond, which
 *  means that there is some loss in accuracy during conversion (@a fileTime is rounded to the nearest millisecond).
 *  This is fine in most cases, but if your application requires sub-millisecond accuracy in the context of disk
 *  records then do not rely on this function.
 *
 *  @sa QDateTime::fromMSecsSinceEpoch(),
 *  fromMSFileTime(
 *  <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/minwinbase/ns-minwinbase-systemtime">SYSTEMTIME</a>,
