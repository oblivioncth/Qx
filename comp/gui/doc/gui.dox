 *  @defgroup qx-gui Qx GUI
 *
 *  @brief The GUI component contains implementation pertaining to OS UI integration, 2D graphics, basic imaging,
 *  fonts, and text.
 *
 *  @component{Gui}
 *
 *  This component roughly mirrors Qt GUI in terms of scope and organization.
 *
 *  @todo This component is quite bare and for now exists solely to keep dependents of Qt GUI in a separate
 *  component so that console applications don't end up with a UI dependency when using Qx Core.
