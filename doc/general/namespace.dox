 *  @brief The @c Qx namespace is the main namespace through which all non-global functionality of the Qx
 *  library is accessed.
 *
 *  Nearly all library features are nested within this namespace in a similar vein as @c std with the
 *  C++ Standard Library.
 *
 *  See the <a href="globals.html">File Member's Index</a> for all global library elements.
